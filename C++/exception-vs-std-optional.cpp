 *
 * The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the use of exception
 * vs std::optional to indicate run time error.
 *
 * The example extends the University object graph we have and add the
 * following two methods:
 *
 * - std::unique_ptr<Student>
 *     University.delStudentWithException(std::string_view name);
 *   where it throws exception UniversityException_StudentNotExist() which is
 * inheritted from std::runtime_error when student is not found.
 *
 * - std::optional<std::unique_ptr<Student>>
 *     University.delStudentWithOptional(std::string_view name);
 *   where it deletes student from Univeristy object graph and return its
 * pointer reference (smart pointer) via std::optional, otherwise it returns
 * {} for std::optional when the student is not found.
 *
 * Different context and different purpose of the code will warrant use of
 * either way, let assume that we are  writting a layer of code base to store
 * object graph of University, Student, Course and other data model that
 * mrrors real life university' data model, and delStudent method is passed
 * in student name to delete a student record from the data model, and there
 * are a few conditions that prevents that deleting from happening:
 *
 * - the student does not exist in the data model.
 * - the student still owes money that prevent it from deleting her/his record.
 * - the other rules are violated that prevents the student from deleting.
 *
 * The context is that the layer of code base is to model the University data
 * model and it does not include business logic (or soft rules) that governs
 * the application layer functionality, like if student has paid all fees
 * and her/his record is allowed to be deleted, such rules are considered soft
 * rules governed by outer layer of code base, and hence we follow the following
 * approach:
 *
 * - all soft rules violation should be handled outside of the data model than
 *   being checked and enforced through exception after deleting request is
 *   initialized, example is that we should have an application layer that
 *   will query the student record and validate that it has paid all fees
 *   prior to initializing the deletion, hence such rules should not be enforced
 *   as exception in the University data model.
 *
 * - on other hand, if a student record does not exist in the data model, but
 * the deletion request is received, we should throw exception than use null
 * (false) (std::optional), the rational is that the layer initializing the
 * deleting request can pass the exception up the stack to other layer to
 * handle, either an error prompt on UI or a properly wrapper error code to
 * cloud api that initializes the delete request
 *
 * on other hand, we might use a layered approach where we have
 * delStudentWithOptional as private method that is not exposed to public, so
 * that internal logic of the University data model will use
 * delStudentWithOptional to query if the student record prior to deleting, but
 * public will use delStudentWithException that initializes deletion through
 * delStudentWithOptional, and throws exception if the it returns the
 * std::optional<std::unique_ptr<Student>> as null (false).
