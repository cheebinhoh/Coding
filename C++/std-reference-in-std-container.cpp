 *
 * The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the use of std-reference
 * in std container class (e.g std::vector) vs copy each element into
 * std container class.
 *
 * An efficient object graph is that there is a parent child ownership
 * reference that a parent object owns a set of child objects through
 * raw pointer or smart pointer, and then if different objects under the
 * same object graph will have to reference to each through std container
 * class, we can store the reference to avoid copying of object or store
 * id that can reference the object through root object in the graph.
 *
 * The alternatives are to use:
 * - smart pointer (std::weak_ptr or std::shared_ptr) with std container
 *   class.
 *
 * - object will store id of another object under the same object graph,
 *   so any reference to the detail of the referenced object will be
 *   resolved through the object graph' root.
 *
 * A lot of mechanism needed to add to object graph management code to
 * maintain integrity of the reference, example if object A references
 * object B under the same object graph, if B is removed, how do we reset
 * the reference from A? do we do it actively or only when the reference
 * is accessed.
