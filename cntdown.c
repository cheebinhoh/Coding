 *
 * A program that returns number of seconds until target date time.
 * it is toy program created in respond to a friend leaving a bad company
 * and how I told him that I am going to create an app show the count down
 * until his last day.
 *
 * It is more like a joke, but it spawns out that I can use this opportunity
 * to write a little C program and companion shell script to demonstate 
 * Unix philosophy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy).
 *
 * It exhibits Unix philosophy, the program does a single task, determine
 * number of seconds until the target datetime, it accepts date time
 * in the following strftime format %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S by default, but
 * user can specify a different format with -f argument, then it returns
 * the number of seconds by printing it, do one thing and do it well.
 *
 * I also added a companion front end shell program that can do fun thing
 * on top of this program, like calling this program repeatedly until count
 * down is zero, silent mode or other options.
 *
 * Happy coding!
