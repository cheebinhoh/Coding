# codingtest

A repository to store my practice of coding test. It is in C which is just a convenient choice because 
I spent signifiant amount of time on Unix, GNU/Linux and C. But it can be in any programming language,
once you master the art of programming, a programming language is a tool.

Most of the coding test are interview questions (answers are mine :)) from big tech companies,
like Apple or Amazon that I found online to practice my coding skill before my next move, 
some are exercises from book I read.

If you found a bug or have a better idea about some improvement, please ping me, so I can learn and
be better on it.

to compile it, just type "make all" at any GNU/Linux command prompt or macOS command line.
