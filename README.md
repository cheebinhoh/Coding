# codingtest

A repository to store my practice of coding test. It is in C which is just a convenient choice because I was built by Unix and grew up with C. But it can be in any programming language, once you master the art of programming, a programming language is not more than a pencil to an artist who masters the art of painting.

If you found a bug or have a better idea about some improvement, please ping me, so I can learn and be better on it.
