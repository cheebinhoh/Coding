# Coding

A repository to store my practice of coding. It is mostly in C which is just a convenient 
choice because I spent signifiant amount of time on Unix, GNU/Linux and C. But it can be
in any programming language, once you master the art of programming, a programming language
is a tool.

Most of the coding test are interview questions (answers are mine :)) from big tech companies,
like Apple or Amazon that I found online to practice my coding skill before my next move, 
some are exercises from book I read.

Some other are just snippest of code I wrote to snapshot specific features of a particular
programming language, like C++ smart pointer.

If you found a bug or have a better idea about some improvement, please ping me, so I can
learn and be better on it.

To compile it, just type "make all" at any GNU/Linux command prompt or macOS command line.
