# codingtest
A repository to store my practice of coding test. It is in C (mostly foreseeable), C is just a convenient choice as I was built in Unix and grow up with C. But it can be in any programming language, once you master the art of programming, a programming language is not more than  a pencil to an artist who master in the art of painting.

If you found bug or have better idea about some improvement, please ping me, so I can learn and be better on it.
