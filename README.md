# codingtest
A repository to store my practice of coding test. It is in C (mostly foreseeable), C is just a convenient choice as I was built in Unix and grow up with C. But it can be in any programming language, once you master the art of programming, a programming language is not more than  a pencil to an artist who master in the art of painting.

If you subject improvement to the logic, please explain the pro and con of the choice, and so that we can all learn.
