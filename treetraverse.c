/* a post order traverse logic:
 *
 * we start at the root, then we process left branch as far as possible, once we exhaust left branch, we process right branch,
 * then we go up one level, and process parent node, after parent node is done, we process right branch of grand parent node, 
 * and so on.
 *
 * So we do it in post order fashion.
 *
 * How to do it in none-recursive fashion?
 *
 * - we do none-recursive loop way to traverse the tree
 * - we start at the root, if root is not NULL, we go in loop
 * - if root->left is not NULL, we need to process left branch and then backtrack to right branch and then parent node of the branches, so we store
 *   root (parent node) in rightPendingList, then assign root to be root->left
 * - if root->left is NULL, but root->right is not NULL, then let store the root in topPendingList so we want to backtrack to 
 *   process the node (after processing right branch), and then we assign right branch to root
 * - if we have exhausted left or right branches of a node (root), then we need to bracktrack, so the backtracking is logic as that
 *   -- if topPendingList is not empty, and the top (of topPendingList) right branch is same as root, then the root is at the right branch of top of 
 *      topPendingList, then we print the root->val, and we bracktrack by assigning top of topPendingList to root, so eventually we are backtracking
 *      from right branch back up to top, until the top->right is not same as root
 *   -- once we backtrack to parent node enough, we start to process right branch by looking at top of rightPendingList and if the top 
 *      has right branch is NULL, we will backtrack further on rightPendingList until we exhaust it or a top that its right branch is not NULL.
 *
 * rightPendingList is to store node that its right branch is pending to be processed
 * topPendingList is to store node that its left branch has processed, right branch is now in process, but its node is not yet processed
 *
