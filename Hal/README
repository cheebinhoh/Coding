This repository contains a small hardware abstraction layer
in c/c++ with a distributed messaging and synchronization protocol.

The ultimate goal is to implement a simple distributed messaging
and synchronization protocol that can be integrated with Application
and free the application from leading with networking, messaging 
format, synchronization of multiple read/write beyond a simple
update conflict notification and retry resolution.

It is similar to MQTT, Kafla or IBM MQ in purpose, but simple, 
lightweight, network agnostics (why limit it to networked processes?
when we can use it between IPC process).

The library is implemeneted in C++ and hopefully it is doing it
right way through delegation design pattern and fully extensible
and customizable without proliferation of Classes.

Why do this? The answer is that I love programming, and like any
art or one who love music, you do it even when no one appreciate
that and it does not bring any tangible result beyond the joke
of the process of doing it.
