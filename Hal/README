This repository contains a small hardware abstraction layer
in c++/c.

The ultimate goal is to implement a cross-platform distributed
messaging protocol that layered on top of tcp, ip or multicast
message for application service discovery, message exchanging
between nodes in a distributed manner, and provide synchronization
mechanism to sync message across nodes, processes and thread.

In a way that done correctly in c++ with good design (more delegation),
asynchronous execution for low latency and clean code.
