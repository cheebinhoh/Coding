/* A post order traverse in iterative way:
 *
 * If we are at a node, we will process left child node (if any), and then
 * process right child node (if any), and then the node that owns the left and
 * right child nodes. When we are in a child node, we will apply same processing
 * ordering (left, right and node itself).
 *
 * It is a depth first approach starting at the left branch, so we will further
 * deeper on the left and then to right branch, and apply the same left, right
 * and node ordering, then go up one level to another right branch and apply the
 * same left, right and node ordering.
 *
 * How to do it in none-recursive fashion?
 *
 * - we do none-recursive loop to traverse the tree.
 * - we start at the root, if root is not NULL, we continue the loop.
 * - if root->left is not NULL, we need to process left branch and then
 * backtrack to right branch and then parent node of the branches, so we store
 * root (parent node) in rightPendingList (the name indicates that right branch
 * is pending to be processed), and then assign root->left to be new root and
 * continue the loop.
 * - if root->left is NULL, but root->right is not NULL, then we need to process
 * the right node and then back to the root later, let store the root in
 * topPendingList so we want to backtrack to it after we exhaust the right
 * branch, we assign root->right to be new root and continue the loop.
 * - if we have exhausted left or right branches of a node (root), then we need
 * to bracktrack, so the backtracking is logic as that
 *   -- if topPendingList is not empty, and we peek at the top (of
 * topPendingList), and if the top's right branch is equal to the root now, then
 * we are at the right branch of top, then we pop out top from topPendingList,
 * and assigning it to the root, and continue the loop, eventually we are
 * backtracking from right branch backward to higher branch of the tree.
 *
 *      we will continue that backtracking from right branch up the tree until
 * we are reach a top from topPendingList that it right branch is not equal to
 * root.
 *
 *   -- once we backtrack enough from right branch either by exhausting the
 * topPendingList, or reach top of the topPendingList that its right branch is
 * not equal to root, then we will process rightPendingList if its node has
 * right branch.
 *
 * rightPendingList is to store node that its right branch is pending to be
 * processed. topPendingList is to store node that its left branch has
 * processed, right branch is now in process, but its node is not yet processed.
