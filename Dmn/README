This repository contains a distributed messaging and synchronization
protocol in c/c++.

The ultimate goal is to implement a simple distributed messaging
and synchronization protocol that can be integrated with Application
and free the application from deading with networking, messaging 
format, synchronization of concurrent read & write and deal with
conflict in multiple writers. 

The library is implemeneted in C++ and hopefully it is doing it
right way through delegation design pattern and fully extensible
and customizable without proliferation of Classes.
