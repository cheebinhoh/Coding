This repository contains a distributed messaging and synchronization
protocol in c/c++.

The ultimate goal is to implement a simple distributed messaging
and synchronization protocol that can be integrated with Application
and free the application from leading with networking, messaging 
format, synchronization of multiple read/write beyond a simple
update conflict notification and retry resolution.

It is similar to MQTT, Kafla or IBM MQ in purpose, but simple, 
lightweight, network agnostics (why limit it to networked processes?
when we can use it between IPC process).

The library is implemeneted in C++ and hopefully it is doing it
right way through delegation design pattern and fully extensible
and customizable without proliferation of Classes.
